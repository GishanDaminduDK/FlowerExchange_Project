# Flower Trading Platform

Welcome to the Flower Trading Platform project, brought to you by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG).

## Project Overview

- A project from the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG).
- This project is a model of a real stock exchange, but with a unique twist: it uses flowers as the trading assets.
- The core of the exchange application is built using C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
- Our primary focus during development was on maximizing efficiency and optimizing the speed of the program.

## Why Flowers?

Flowers might seem like an unusual choice for a stock exchange, but they provide an interesting and creative way to demonstrate the principles of trading and financial markets. By simulating real-world trading scenarios with flowers, we can make complex financial concepts more accessible and engaging.

## Key Features

- **Realistic Simulation**: The Flower Trading Platform provides a realistic simulation of a stock exchange, complete with order matching, trading algorithms, and market data updates.

- **Efficiency**: We have put a significant emphasis on optimizing the program for speed and efficiency, ensuring that it can handle a large volume of trades without compromising performance.

- **User-Friendly**: While the underlying system is complex, the user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced traders.



Thank you for your interest in the Flower Trading Platform project. We hope you enjoy exploring the world of flower trading in a unique and educational way!
